# Alfie -- a diary generator

This is Alfie, a python script capable of generating diary inserts in pocket, personal or A5 size of any year you want. The script in itself makes a LaTeX file ready for typesetting.

Right now, Alfie can make diaries in Swedish and English. It can render holidays and date-specific notes, as listed in used-provided text files. It can also add front and back matter, as supplied by supplementary files.

## Manual

It should work out of the box. At run-time the script will guide you through a few set-up questions, asking for the paper size, the language, the year and whether you want to add frontmatter or backmatter.
